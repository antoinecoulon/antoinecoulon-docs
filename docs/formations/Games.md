[Practical Project : Sonic Themed Infinite Runner](https://substack.com/redirect/46d1037b-401e-4bf2-9ed4-6082bd047d82?j=eyJ1IjoiMW9rZ2k3In0.50HS33Aazin35IzBxuY-xnoQfNfV-KPDg2_9moWu9tA)

In this course, you’ll learn how to build a Sonic themed infinite runner game. The player runs indefinitely but gets progressively faster. They must survive by either avoiding or jumping on enemies while collecting as many rings as they can. You can try out the game in your browser here.

You’ll be progressively introduced to KAPLAY concepts as we build the game.
Development Setup

[How to use KAPLAY without dealing with Node.js, Bundlers and NPM](https://substack.com/redirect/0584ebc3-0f6d-4bbb-9794-b154f4c4de06?j=eyJ1IjoiMW9rZ2k3In0.50HS33Aazin35IzBxuY-xnoQfNfV-KPDg2_9moWu9tA)

In this course, I set up my development environment using NPM, Vite and Node. While these technologies arent’t hard for experienced web developers, they might be too complex for beginners. There is a simpler setup you can use that I present in the post below.

Now that you have the basics, you can start making your own games. Additionally, you can check my other substack posts explaining how to implement specific mechanics/how certain KAPLAY concepts work.
